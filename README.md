# AIK Front

A modern React starter powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It includes sensible defaults for linting, testing, and local development so you can focus on building features.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Available scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the development server with hot reloading.
- `npm run build` – bundle the app for production.
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally.
- `npm run test` – run unit tests with Vitest and Testing Library.
